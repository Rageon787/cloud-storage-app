# Cloud Storage Service

This is a lightweight cloud storage service — a RESTful API written in Golang using:
- Gin-Gonic, An HTTP web framework
- SQLite, Database for storing user accounts 
- Azure Storage Accounts for file storage in the cloud 

It includes support for file upload, deletion, retrieval, and user authentication — all with zero-knowledge encryption! 

## Features 
- User registration and authentication (with hashed passwords)
- File upload, retrieval, and deletion
- SQLite for local account management and file metadata
